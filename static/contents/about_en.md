In 2016, during my middle school days, I embarked on a **journey of curiosity and discovery**, tinkering with DIY drones, 3D printers, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. This adventurous beginning served as a gateway, immersing me deeply into the realms of programming and web development. As I transitioned from hardware to the digital realm, I cultivated an affinity for **both front-end and back-end** development.

Having recently **completed a Master of Science in Computer Science from UTT**, I bring with me not just academic credentials but substantial professional experience as well. My first foray into the professional tech world began with a six-month internship at [**Grytics**](https://grytics.com), where I honed my programming skills. This was followed by a second internship at [**Selectra**](https://careers.selectra.com/), working as a Full-stack Web Engineer. These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of technology. It's now time for me to **seek the best opportunities to start my career** and make a significant impact in the tech industry.

Despite my busy academic schedule, I make it a point to nurture **my love for side projects**. My ventures range from creating unique 3D printer projects along with FPV drones and even Web stuff such as Twitch or social networks with Artificial Intelligence â€” a testament to my enduring fondness for the blend of creativity and technology.

Away from the screens and circuits, I'm an active individual with a keen interest in calisthenics, climbing and hiking. The thrill of a new trail or the satisfaction of a well-executed workout **keeps me grounded and invigorated**. Simultaneously, I'm continually broadening my horizons by delving into the world of graphic design, a hobby that **adds a splash of artistic inspiration to my technically-oriented mindset**.

When I reflect on my journey so far, I realize it's the perfect blend of code, creativity, and outdoor adventures that **keeps me excited about each day ahead**.
