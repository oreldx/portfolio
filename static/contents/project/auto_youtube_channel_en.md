# Autonomous Youtube Channel

This project involved crafting a YouTube channel dedicated to daily "best-of" compilations of top Twitch clips, enhanced with fancy overlays to enrich user experience. Utilizing Python for channel management, tasks encompassed data scrapping, resource acquisition, and content selection & creation.


## Introduction

This is **my first personal programming project**, and notably my learning of **Python, APIs, FFmpeg, Docker, and hosting on a VPS**.  
It involved developing a YouTube channel specializing in daily compilations of the **best Twitch clips**.  
The goal was to enrich the **user experience** with graphic assets.  
The project relies on Twitch's API for **scraping and storing** data, and also involves **resource acquisition**, **content selection**, and its **automatic publication**.


## Video Structure

**Video extract**

Each compiled video featured a **dynamic structure**:

-   Top left: a **summary** displaying the names of the streamers
    
-   Right: the selected **Twitch clip**
    
-   Bottom left: the **thumbnail of the game**
    
-   Bottom right: the **title of the clip**
    

**Calls to action for sharing and subscribing** (**Call to Action**) were integrated throughout the video, complemented by an outro at the end.

## Thumbnail Design

The **thumbnails** of each video were designed to capture the viewers' attention, with bright colors and eye-catching graphic elements.  
The **most popular streamers were highlighted** in the center with predefined images, while the profile photos of other streamers appeared in side circles.  
The episode number and a screenshot of two viral clips formed the background, with the option to vary the colors of the background, title, and numbers according to **several combinations**.
