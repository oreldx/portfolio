This project entailed developing a Python-based Social Networks automation solution. Key features include data extraction, AI-powered content generation, automated post uploads, and community engagement. A whole architecture was designed to manage multiple accounts and tasks.


### Introduction

This project aims to develop a **complete automation solution for social media**, using **Flask, Vue.js, Node.js, Remotion, Redis, Celery, MySQL, and Docker**.  
The key features of this solution include data extraction, AI-assisted content generation, and automatic posting. The designed architecture is robust, allowing for **simultaneous management of multiple accounts and various tasks**.


### Demonstration Video

An example of this solution can be observed through a demonstration video. The core content of the video, a poem, is generated by a large language model (**LLM**).  
Additionally, the video incorporates a royalty-free background, carefully selected and adapted for the occasion. The **subtitles**, enriched with emojis, are synchronized with the **text narration** by a generative AI. A soundtrack accompanies the whole to enhance the experience.
